TeamSlap is an application for managing sports teams and leagues. It is based on the core functions of the popular TeamSnap.com, but with some additional and some missing features.

TeamSlap features not available on TeamSnap:
- Create and manage leagues, which passes information (schedules, etc.) down to teams that are a part of the league.
- Create and edit lineups for each game, identifying a position then assigning it to an available player.

Features common to both:
- Create a team, add and remove players. 
- Players can indicate availability for upcoming games.

Upcoming changes:
- Design tweaks
- Ability to save lineup formations for future events to avoid having to create positions for each event.

In Progress:
- Updating Repo Name, lineup order preservation.
